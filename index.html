          <p>
            A Polar Expedition doesn't have to be to the North or South pole.
            There are places much closer to home and less extreme.
            Northern Sweden is an amazing place that offers beautiful landscapes and is more accessible.
            It's a place where you can look and not see anything or anyone around you - that's why they call it the
            Europe's last wilderness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Swedish expeditions take place within the Arctic Circle, on the northern section of the Kings Trail (Kungsleden in Swedish).
            The whole trail continues for 440km, but we use the best part of it and it's around 90km.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll get to experience <b>Kungsleden</b> in an authentic way and recover in comfort.
            For some it will be once in a lifetime trip, for others a stepping stone towards more challenging
            expeditions.
            One thing is guaranteed - it's going to be an unforgettable experience.

          <p>
            Kungleden - that's the name of the trail in Sweden along which the expeditions take place. 
            The landscape is very beautiful but we must not forget that the weather can change in a matter of minutes.
            It can completely shift form a sunny day to a total whiteout. If you don't know where you are and how to
            behave, you can get yourself in trouble. Luckily you won't be alone and we come well prepared.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use high quality Nordic back country ski's to transport ourselves over the snow, 
            it's like walking with slight glide and it's very easy to learn.
            Just putting one foot in front of the other in an environment
            allows your mind to go blank at times and it this creates a meditative experience.

            We currently offer two types of (Nordic) ski touring expeditions in Sweden. Both use the same route and have
            the same duration.
            The main difference is accommodation - either huts or tents. Both are unique experiences with their own
            benefits. The hut tour is more accessible as it requires less gear and is therefore easier to do.

              Choosing huts means we can travel light as we don't need much equipment.
              Four of the six huts along the trail have a small shop where you can buy food.
              The last one, technically a mountain station, also has a restaurant.
              Even when camping, we can choose to spend a night in a hut to warm up, dry clothes and equipment and
              even use the sauna.

              <h5>Day 1</h5>
              <p>In the morning we meet in a city called Kiruna and travel together to Abisko where we will stay for the
                night.
                We will spend the afternoon getting comfortable on our skis and with out safety equipment.
                Kiruna can be reached by train or plane.</p>

              <h5>Day 2</h5>
              <p>First day on the trail we will travel through Abisko National Park. The first half of it is through a
                birch forrest,
                second part we will cross a frozen lake with Abiskojaure as our destination for the day.
                There we will find a small shop, warm huts and a sauna.

              <h5>Day 3</h5>
              <p>
                This will be the longest day of the journey so it's very important we start early.
                The first hour will be on a flat, which will be a good warm up for the not very steep, but quite long
                uphill that awaits us.
                Towards the end of the day we will take a break inside King's hut and then continue for few more hours
                across a frozen lake to Alesjaure.
                Hot sauna will be our reward.

              <h5>Day 4</h5>
              <p>
                After a long journey the day before, this day will be easier as we're heading to Tjäktja. We will stay
                at the hut, located half hour away from the pass itself.
                This is one of the smaller huts, so there's no shop or sauna, but we do have views of the pass.

              <h5>Day 5</h5>
              <p>The day will start with a relatively mild uphill bringing us to the highest pass on the trail: Tjäktja
                Pass.
                Here the views really start to open up and if the weather permits, we will have some of the best views
                on the trip.
                Then we will go down, either fast or zig-zagging slowly. From there is an easy 4 hour cruise to Sälka.
                Shop & sauna available.

              <h5>Day 6</h5>
              <p>Today we travel from Sälka to Singi. It should be an easy day of around 4-5h depending on the weather.
                The small hills will give you a chance to practice your down-hill technique - that's great fun.
                Half way we can stop in an emergency shelter to warm up and bit and have a second breakfast - that will
                give us a boost for the second part of the day.

              <h5>Day 7</h5>
              <p>We start the day with a bit of an uphill and then we will head to Kebnekaise through the valleys.
                This day will not be long but it might challenge us with icy terrain. This will be the windiest part
                of the trail. Lucky for us, the wind will be in our backs. Still, it's important to stay focussed.
                Kebnekeise will offer us a comfortable hut, long awaited showers and a fancy meal in a restaurant.

              <p>This is where our expedition will come to an end. After breakfast we will be picked up by a snow mobile
                that will bring us
                to a nearby town called Nikkaluokta, from where we will be transported back to Kiruna.

                  No skiing experience is required. You can learn what you need in a few hours on the first day.
                  If you're unsure - get in touch and we can discuss what you could do at home to prepare.
                  Think of balance exercises, (ice) skating or indoor skiing. All could be beneficial.
                  For the camping expeditions, it's best if you have some experience (winter) camping.

                  The huts are maintained by the Swedish Tourist Association. To stay there we book them and pay just
                  like a hotel.
                  The rooms are shared and have bunk beds. There are kitchens with gas stoves and even dining rooms.
                  We get fresh water from under the ice.
                  In contrast, some operators go outside of the season and (to reduce the cost) use the hut's that are
                  meant for emergency use only to stay at. 
                  We do it the right way and actually book and pay for the stay (the price is included). 
                  This also gives us the ability to use all of the facilities like the kitchen and perhaps most important - the sauna.
                  As a member of our team you will also get 1 year membership of the Swedish Tourist Association with various benefits.
                  Our last stay (day 7) will be at Kebnekaise mountain station. The station offers more luxuries like hot showers and normal toilets.

                  Like mentioned earlier, being outside is not without risks, but our focus is keeping everyone safe and
                  mitigate any potential risks.
                  We travel during the winter season when the huts and mountain stations are open so 
                  that there's support available in case of an emergency.
                  They can be contacted via satellite communication devices that we bring.
                  Your guide has completed a first aid course and the group is carrying a first aid kit.
                  Additionally, the guide has knowledge and experience on the specific route and terrain, both in winter
                  and summer.
                  During the expedition we're not crossing any glaciers and we avoid any potential avalanche zones.
                  The weather is being monitored throughout the winter so we can better understand the snow conditions.

                  Nutrition is very important during an expedition as we'll need a lot of calories.
                  This is why we'll take care of it for you.
                  The food is included in the expedition: breakfast, lunch and dinner while on the trail.
                  The meals are carefully selected, prepared and tested on many expeditions.
                  You'll have choice and we can adjust for any dietary restrictions.
                  There's also a possibility to purchase additional snacks during the trip.

          <p>
            Everyone has their own reasons for seeking out a trip like this.
            During the golden age of exploration, seemingly ordinary men achieved extraordinary things.
            One of the first two men that stood on top of Everest, Sir Edmund Hillary was a beekeeper by trade.
            What made them different was the drive for exploration.
            <br><br>
            These days our lives are so effortless. We live in cities with everything we might desire available to us.
            Because of our comforts we loose touch with nature and with ourselves.
            Literally getting out of your comfort zone can help you reconnect with yourself and nature during the day,
            while still enjoying the safety and comfort of a hut or tent at night.
            <br><br>
            Why do you want to join? Is it the physical and mental challenge? Is it for the scenery, or just some piece
            and quiet?
            Get in touch and let us know.

          <h3>Robert Lewandowski</h3>
          <p>
            Based in Amsterdam, with no mountains in sight,
            Robert fell in love with Scandinavia and especially the cold Arctic climate and has been coming back every
            year.
            Wanting to make these experiences accessible to others he founded Polar Exped.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides touring in Sweden, Robert enjoys climbing in the Alps and mountaineering the Himalaya.
            Previous climbs include various 4000m peaks around Chamonix Mont Blanc and 6119m summit of Lobuche East,
            neighboring Mt. Everest. Skiing expeditions have also taken him to the Greenland Ice Cap. 
            One of the future dreams is to visit Antarctica and ski to the South Pole.
