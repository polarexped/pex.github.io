Imagine standing beneath a vast, starlit sky, your breath visible in the crisp air, when suddenly, the heavens begin to stir. At first, it might be just a faint glow on the horizon, but then, as if on cue, ribbons of green, purple, and pink light unfurl across the sky, twisting and weaving like a celestial ballet.
