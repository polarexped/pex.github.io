The first half of it is through a birch forrest, second part we will cross a frozen lake with Abiskojaure as our destination for the day. There we will find a small shop, warm huts and a sauna.</p></div><div class="card" data-v-54233a3d><img class="" src="'+T+'" loading="lazy" alt="impression photo" height="175" style="pointer-events:none;" data-v-54233a3d><h4 data-v-54233a3d>Day 3</h4><p data-v-54233a3d>This will be the longest day of the journey so it&#39;s very important we start early. The first hour will be on a flat, which will be a good warm up for the not very steep, but quite long uphill that awaits us. Towards the end of the day we will take a break inside King&#39;s hut and then continue for few more hours across a frozen lake to Alesjaure. Hot sauna will be our reward.</p></div><div class="card" data-v-54233a3d><img class="" src="'+x+'" loading="lazy" alt="impression photo" height="175" style="pointer-events:none;" data-v-54233a3d><h4 data-v-54233a3d>Day 4</h4><p data-v-54233a3d>After a long journey the day before, this day will be easier as we&#39;re heading to Tj채ktja. We will stay at the hut, located half hour away from the pass itself. This is one of the smaller huts, so there&#39;s no shop or sauna, but we do have views of the pass.</p></div><div class="card" data-v-54233a3d><img class="" src="'+z+'" loading="lazy" alt="impression photo" height="175" style="pointer-events:none;" data-v-54233a3d><h4 data-v-54233a3d>Day 5</h4><p data-v-54233a3d>The day will start with a relatively mild uphill bringing us to the highest pass on the trail: Tj채ktja Pass. Here the views really start to open up and if the weather permits, we will have some of the best views on the trip. Then we will go down, either fast or zig-zagging slowly. From there is an easy 4 hour cruise to S채lka. Shop &amp; sauna available.</p></div><div class="card" data-v-54233a3d><img class="" src="'+D+'" loading="lazy" alt="impression photo" height="175" style="pointer-events:none;" data-v-54233a3d><h4 data-v-54233a3d>Day 6</h4><p data-v-54233a3d>Today we travel from S채lka to Singi. It should be an easy day of around 4-5h depending on the weather. The small hills will give you a chance to practice your down-hill technique - that&#39;s great fun. Half way we can stop in an emergency shelter to warm up and bit and have a second breakfast - that will give us a boost for the second part of the day.</p></div><div class="card" data-v-54233a3d><img class="" src="'+j+'" loading="lazy" alt="impression photo" height="175" style="pointer-events:none;" data-v-54233a3d><h4 data-v-54233a3d>Day 7</h4><p data-v-54233a3d>We start the day with a bit of an uphill and then we will head to Kebnekaise through the valleys. This day will not be long but it might challenge us with icy terrain. This will be the windiest part of the trail. Lucky for us, the wind will be in our backs. Still, it&#39;s important to stay focussed. Kebnekaise will offer us a comfortable hut, long awaited showers and a fancy meal in a restaurant. </p></div><div class="card" data-v-54233a3d><img class="" src="'+L+'" loading="lazy" alt="impression photo" height="175" style="pointer-events:none;" data-v-54233a3d><h4 data-v-54233a3d>Day 8</h4><p data-v-54233a3d>This is where our expedition will come to an end.
